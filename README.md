# College Website (React)

This repository contains a small React scaffold for a college website. Files and folders were created to match the structure you provided.

Quick start:

1. Node.js (v18+) installed
2. In the project root run:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

The project uses Vite for fast local development. Place real images under `public/assets/images` or update component paths to point to `src/assets/images` and import them.
